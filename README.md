# ShieldShot [GMTK 2018 Game Jam]

A game made within 48 hours for the [2018 GMTK game jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2018). This is also the first game I have ever made in Unity!

As you would expect, the code quality is rushed and not very good. But I thought it would be worth uploading for anyone who is curious.
