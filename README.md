# ShieldShot [GMTK 2018 Game Jam]

A game made within 48 hours for the [2018 GMTK game jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2018). The theme was "Game genre with a missing mechanic". For ShieldShot I decided to make a space shooter where you cant shoot, 
instead you have to use your shield to deflect bullets back at the enemies. One main limitation is that using the shield consumed energy, so you have to balance using the shield or trying the evade enemy attacks
while it recharges.

This is also the first game I have ever made in Unity. As you would expect, the code quality is rushed and not very good. But I thought it would be worth uploading for anyone who is curious.
